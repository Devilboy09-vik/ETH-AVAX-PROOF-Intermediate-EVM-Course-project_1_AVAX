# ETH-AVAX-PROOF-Intermediate-EVM-Course

## Project Title
write a smart contract that implements the require(), assert() and revert() statements.
## Description
This is a simple project for simulating the development of smart contracts using Remix IDE and the Solidity language .Firstly We use the modifier and constructor. Then make deposit,withdraw,getbalance and totalbalance function.In this project we use the error handling concept. so, We use the revert() , require() and assert() .

### Getting started
## Installing
* To run the project code, you need an IDE where you can run the Solidity language.One such IDE is the online Remix IDE (https://remix.ethereum.org/), which you can run on any browser of your choice.
* The code in this project can be used by simply copying it to the editor of any IDE where you can run Solidity version 0.8.7.
## Executing program
* How to run the program

1. Copy the Solidity code provided in the "project_1_AVAX" file.

2. Open Remix IDE (https://remix.ethereum.org/).

3. In the Remix IDE, create a new file and paste the copied code into it.

4. Compile the Code by either pressing "Ctrl + S" to compile the code or using the Compile button in the Remix IDE interface.

5. Use the Deploy button in the Remix IDE to deploy the contract to a local Ethereum network or a test network.

6. Use the deployed contract's interface in Remix IDE  and then deposit the ether and then input some ether in the deposit button and then call the deposit function and then call the getbalance and total balance.

## Code 


## Help 

If you encounter any issues or have any questions, here are some common solutions:

1. Ensure you are using Solidity version 0.8.7 or later.

2. Check the Remix IDE console for error messages and follow the guidance provided.
